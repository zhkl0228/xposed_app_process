This copy is a fork of rovo89's app_process. All credit goes to @rovo89.

What I've done on this copy:
- Change Android.mk to build `app_process32` and `app_process64` instead of those with `_xpsoed` extension.
- Compatibility with Android N.

Please see [this repository](https://github.com/abforce/xposed_art_n)'s README.md for more information.
